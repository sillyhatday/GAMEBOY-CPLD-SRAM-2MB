>I cut the 5V plane coming from the 5v cart pin and bridged it with a 2.2Ω shunt resistor. Voltage was then measured accross the resistor to determine current used.

## Summary

I did not expect the MAX3000 chips to get worse with a *better* firmware. It's not a huge difference, but it is there. I also did not expect the MAX7000 to get better! There is obviously some architecture differences that favour the older ***long*** obselete MAX7000 series.

The unfortunate data comes from the Atmel chips. I was hopeful these would be competative with the others as they are the only readily availible items. Not only have I had endless troubles getting save RAM to work properly, the amount of power used is too high. For example, a stock DMG running a stock Pokemon Blue cart uses between 44 - 60mA for the entire console...

The clear winner is the 3032A, with the lowest power use and it also being the cheapest to purchase.

Second place is a tie between the 3064A and 7032S. While the 3064A is the cheaper of the two, the 7032S is better on power. I call it a draw as the 7032S doesn't cost a lot more than the 3064A.

Last place its the 1502A with awful power draw, highest price, harder to program and still not fully working.
